Style: Factual, competent, and future-oriented.

Speakers: Calm, level-headed, and trustworthy tone. Experts preparing a complex topic for colleagues.

Tonality: Not promotional, but competent and radiating a positive yet realistic vision for the future. Like an experienced mentor. An engaged professional conversation, not a monotonous lecture.

Speaker 1: You can barely open a professional journal these days without stumbling over Artificial Intelligence. You read about a revolution everywhere. But if I'm honest, I wonder how much of that truly impacts our daily work as appraisers.

Speaker 2: That is exactly the bridge from theory to practice that we are building in our HypZert Perspective Paper, "Vision of AI-supported ecosystems in real estate valuation." Most people think of AI only in terms of Automated Valuation Models, or AVMs.

Speaker 1: ...which are the statistical models we've been using for years for quick indications.

Speaker 2: Exactly. But that is only the tip of the iceberg. We looked at the entire value chain—from data collection to report generation.

Speaker 1: That sounds very comprehensive. What is the paper's central thesis? Are appraisers being replaced?

Speaker 2: Quite the opposite. The vision we see is not that of the AI-driven robot, but of the "Augmented Valuer". This describes a highly skilled expert whose capabilities are enhanced by AI-powered cognitive tools. You should not think of AI as a competitor, but as an extremely capable co-pilot working in the background.





Speaker 1: A co-pilot...

Speaker 2: Precisely. The appraiser retains control and bears full responsibility at all times. But they are relieved of routine tasks and gain deeper insights for their analysis. Our role shifts from data processor to strategic analyst and system manager.





Speaker 1: That's a fundamental shift. "System manager" sounds like we're just monitoring the machine.

Speaker 2: Not just monitoring—steering. The "Augmented Valuer" uses AI as an intelligent assistance system. Think of it this way: The AI takes over the 80% of routine work—data collection, sifting through documents, drafting standard text blocks. This allows the appraiser to focus on the 20% that requires human judgment: the complex analysis, qualitative assessment, and final validation. The responsibility remains 100% with the human.



Speaker 1: Okay, then let's go through this practically. Let's take an appraiser in their daily work. Where does the AI co-pilot begin to help?


Speaker 2: Right at the start: with data collection. Instead of manually downloading documents from various portals and databases, an AI agent can automate this process.




Speaker 1: That alone saves time, but that's not "intelligence" yet.

Speaker 2: Right. Even more important is intelligent document processing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been used to read unstructured documents for some time. But now, with Large Language Models (LLMs), language recognition and the structuring of this unstructured data become even more precise and faster.





Speaker 1: Give me an example. What does the AI read?


Speaker 2: The AI reads documents like land registry extracts, rental agreements, or building permits. It not only extracts the important information—like rental space, lease term, rent—but, and this is the key, it also flags critical clauses or discrepancies. For example, it could report: "Attention, in this 50-page commercial lease, there is an unusual rent-free period noted on page 38, which deviates from the information in the data room."


Speaker 1: That's already an enormous relief. But the fundamental problem of fragmented data sources remains, doesn't it? I still have to tediously obtain the land registers, the data from the expert committees, the declarations of division, one by one.

Speaker 2: You've hit on one of the most important points. The vision, which goes far beyond today's applications, is exactly that: a secure, central, and uniform repository for all this data.

Speaker 1: What do you mean? Some kind of "federal database"?

Speaker 2: For example. Imagine if there were standardized, digital, and real-time accessible access to land registers, to the data from expert committees like land value maps or comparable factors, to declarations of division, and other valuation-relevant documents. This data availability alone would be a revolution for the industry.

Speaker 1: And what would the role of AI be then?

Speaker 2: If this data were in one central, secure location, we could apply a controlled AI solution to it. The appraiser would no longer have to search 20 portals and PDFs, but could make a single query: "Show me all encumbrances in Section II of the land register, compare them with the declaration of division, and check for any discrepancies with the expert committee's data." Sifting through that would be an unimaginable relief and would exponentially increase the quality and speed of the valuation.

Speaker 1: That sounds like a desirable future. Back to the present: What happens with the data in the analysis phase after the AI has read it?

Speaker 2: This is where it gets really exciting. Take property analysis. Computer vision technologies, for example, can analyze floor plans and photos to automatically identify features or assess the condition of building elements. The AI can identify and label elements like "hardwood floors," "outdated appliances," or even "water damage".



Speaker 1: And what about market data, especially ESG?


Speaker 2: A crucial point is ESG data integration. AI is uniquely capable of processing diverse and complex ESG data sets—from energy performance certificates to climate risk models. This is essential for a future-proof and resilient market and lending value, especially with regard to the EU taxonomy.



Speaker 1: And the site inspection? Does that become obsolete?


Speaker 2: No, the appraiser's on-site expertise remains central. But technology can support it here too. Think of drones providing high-resolution images of roofs or facades. Or imagine the appraiser is on-site, perhaps with smart glasses, recording their observations via voice command. The video and image data generated during the inspection can be processed immediately by LLMs to create quick reports, while the appraiser continues to concentrate on the inspection.





Speaker 1: This all sounds like huge, expensive IT projects. Drones, central databases... Is that even realistic for a small or medium-sized appraisal office?

Speaker 2: That's an important point. We see the grand visions, but the revolution often starts small. Not all solutions have to involve complex IT systems. Sometimes it's just a process adjustment and a new tool you adopt. There are AI solutions available today that inexpensively and significantly speed up individual process steps. Take a simple example: An AI that takes phone calls and coordinates appointments for site visits can be set up for just a few hundred euros and saves an enormous amount of time. The price for such specialized tools often remains manageable.

Speaker 1: Let's turn to AVMs. You mentioned they are often a "black box." How does that change with the new developments?

Speaker 2: Exactly. The "black box" problem was a major criticism of traditional AVMs; they gave a value, but not the path to it. This is where Large Language Models (LLMs) come in. They don't replace AVMs; they make them fundamentally better.




Speaker 1: Better in what way?


Speaker 2: An LLM-powered AVM can present its reasoning in understandable language. It becomes more accurate because it can now also process unstructured data—meaning it can read and quantify realtor comments like "dream view" or "requires extensive repairs". And it becomes more transparent. It explains: "This property is valued 5% higher because the lot size is larger compared to recently sold properties". This minimizes the black-box problem through Explainable AI (XAI). The best solution remains the hybrid approach: The improved AVM provides an explainable starting point, and the appraiser finalizes the valuation with their local knowledge.





Speaker 1: With all the opportunities, there must certainly be challenges. The paper also addresses issues like data protection, liability, and ethics.


Speaker 2: Absolutely. These are central hurdles. Take liability. Who is liable when the AI makes a mistake? The traditional sole liability of the appraiser becomes difficult. The EU is working on new legal frameworks, like the AI Liability Directive, to possibly create models for shared liability.





Speaker 1: And data protection?


Speaker 2: That is, of course, central. It seems complicated at first glance, precisely because AI models are data-intensive and the GDPR imposes strict rules. But it's important to emphasize that systems can indeed be built securely and performantly. A lot is in flux and changing right now, and "security by design" approaches are becoming established. The solution lies in robust data management procedures and clear governance.




Speaker 1: You just mentioned security. What other risks are there?


Speaker 2: Yes, (cyber) security is a big topic. The systems introduce new attack vectors. Criminals could try to manipulate training data—called "data poisoning"—to deceive the models. Intellectual property (IP) law is also a construction site : Who owns a text generated exclusively by an AI? Were copyrights infringed during the AI's training? These are significant legal risks.





Speaker 1: And how do we ensure that the AI doesn't discriminate?


Speaker 2: That is the ethical challenge. Biased training data could lead to discriminatory outcomes , such as the systematic undervaluation of real estate in certain neighborhoods. That is precisely why the appraiser's role is so important. The EU AI Act and BaFin requirements demand the "Human in the Loop"—meaning human control—for high-risk applications. The appraiser is and remains the final authority that reviews and validates the AI's results.





Speaker 1: That brings me back to costs. We talked about the small tools, but with the big models... isn't there a risk that only large corporations can afford this, distorting competition?


Speaker 2: That is the classic competition risk. The high costs of complex systems can be a barrier to entry. But the perspective is currently shifting. The real competitive risk is increasingly in not planning an AI budget. It's becoming clear that employees who use AI solutions are significantly more productive. Those who ignore these efficiency gains will be left behind. What's important, however, is that fairness in competition—and, of course, in the valuation itself—must be maintained. Algorithms must not lead to unfair market consolidation or discriminatory valuations.

Speaker 1: To conclude: Why is this transition so urgent right now?


Speaker 2: Quite simply: because of demographic change and the shortage of skilled workers. We have no other choice but to make our processes more efficient if we want to maintain our high-quality standards. It's not about cutting jobs, but about supporting the work of existing experts as effectively as possible and advancing the profession.





Speaker 1: That means we have to adapt training and education?

Speaker 2: Absolutely. This is an enormous international effort in education and training that we are facing. We must invest in training and adapting certification standards now. Certification bodies like HypZert will take on this task to ensure the future viability of their graduates.




Speaker 1: So, it's about evolution, not replacement. A very positive and pragmatic vision.

Speaker 2: Exactly. It is a call for collaborative innovation. Associations, companies, and regulators must now work together to set the course for a responsible, AI-supported valuation of tomorrow.





Speaker 1: A strong final word. Thank you very much for this exciting discussion.
